This code does not work as intended because the questionCounter variable for some reason begins to grow exponentially even though im only clicking the answer buttons 5 times. I will continue to look over this code and update it when it the bug is fixed. 

the high scores page is incomplete because the counter variables are not acting as intended. The backend of this code seems to work up until a certain point, sadly it fails at the end :(
